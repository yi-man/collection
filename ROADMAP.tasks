=================================================*/

This file will contain an extremely detailed tasks list
to follow development of new releases.

Unscheduled:
  ❑ Try to use closure compiler or similar to perform maximum compression/optimization and structure sources better

Unscheduled 1.2:
  ❑ Make shared states exportable to QP
  ❑ Make it simpler to deal with ng-repeat and multiple shared states
  ❑ Fix migration for ui-swipe
  ❑ Fix $transform issues decomposing previous rotations
  ❑ Fix or invalidate old ui-switch issues:
